## Abstract: 
Tracking by natural language specification is a new rising research topic that aims at locating the target object in the video sequence based on its language description. Compared with traditional bounding box (BBox) based tracking, this setting guides object tracking with high-level semantic information, addresses the ambiguity of BBox, and links local and global search organically together. Those benefits may bring more flexible, robust and accurate tracking performance in practical scenarios. However, existing natural language initialized trackers are developed and compared on benchmark datasets proposed for tracking-by-BBox, which can't reflect the true power of tracking-by-language. In this work, we propose a new benchmark specifically dedicated to the tracking-by-language, including a large scale dataset, strong and diverse baseline methods. Specifically, we collect 2k video sequences (contains a total of 1,244,340 frames, 663 words) and split 1300/700 for the train/testing respectively. We densely annotate one sentence in English and corresponding bounding boxes of the target object for each video. A strong baseline method based on an adaptive local-global-search scheme is proposed for future works to compare. We believe this benchmark will greatly boost related researches on natural language guided tracking.

## Question and Answer 
**Q1. What is the difference between the proposed "Tracking by natural language" and "video grounding"?** 
A1. As noted in paper [a, b], the video grounding task requires the machine to watch a video and localize the starting and ending time of the target video segment that corresponds to the given query. In contrast, our proposed tasks focus on locating the spatial location in each video frame.

[b] Zeng, Runhao, et al. "Dense regression network for video grounding." Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2020. [[Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Zeng_Dense_Regression_Network_for_Video_Grounding_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf)]  


**Q2. Does it reasonable and fair to compare the language assisted trackers with bbox initialized trackers?**
A2. As mentioned in our paper, the standard visual tracking ignores the semantic information of target object, and it is hard to judge which target we human want to track if only the bounding box is provided in the first frame (for example, the player who controls the ball **v.s.** the player specified and fixed). Therefore, it will be OK to use the TNL2K for the standard evaluation of bbox based trackers. After all, the initialized bbox for all trackers are same. Actually, it is fair to compare the trackers under the same setting of initialization. 



**Q3. What can the language-based-tracking used for?**
A3. For example, police searching for a suspect person or vehicle from a huge amount of videos.
